| **General:** |
| --- |
|
- **--** At the end of November Deputy Medical Coordinator ended her mission, unfortunately without replacement at that moment. New deputy MedCo in Gaza recruited during December 2018 to start at the beginning of January 2019.
- **--** MHPSS manager in WB resigned at the middle of December. Since then, position vacant and recruitment process still pending. FieldCo and MedCo covering so far the gap.
- **--** SRH manager ended her mission at the beginning of December.
- **--** Most of December, coordination team has been almost exclusively focused on the development of proposals, so the follow-up and monitoring of activities have been consequently impacted in somehow. However, field implementing teams have performed in general well, carrying out intervention as planned.
- **--** The coordination with Health and Nutrition Cluster, especially in Gaza, has been strengthened very much through the efficient collaboration in the development of proposals and strategies, mainly on the field of EPREP activities, and by the active and high presence and participation in Cluster meetings.
- **--** There was a very active and dynamic participation in the 16 days campaign against VAWG.
  |
| **Sexual and Reproductive Health:** |
|
- **--** The short-term intervention with Health Work Committee in WB was well in general. The main objective was to capacitate clinical staff to be able to provide proper emergency contraception. The training was generally well received with all participants scoring between 3 and 5 on a 5-point scale on how relevant and informative they found the training. When asked why participants were attending many responded as it was relative to their work and they wanted to improve the advice they could give women. 10 out of the 15 participants stated their knowledge had improved by at least 2 points from a scale of 1-5 (3 participants did not return their evaluation forms). However, still much work to do in terms of acceptancy and acceptability: the provision of contraception to unmarried women is still far away to be seen by service providers as a right with no question, regardless beliefs or opinions from the provider, and the most of them refused to consider the provision of EC to unmarried women unless sexually assaulted.
(Full report of the intervention attached within zip folder)
- **--** Active participation in fundraising activities among potential donors explaining SRH strategy: UNFPA, UN Women, AFD, Canadian representatives, Italian cooperation.
