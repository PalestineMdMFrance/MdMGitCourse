**1. GENERAL:**

**1.1 MEDICAL CONTEXT**

***The mental health and wellbeing of the communities in the northern
West Bank is constantly threatened due to the following factors present
during this month period:***

-   ***Regular and ongoing settlers and ISF violence, harassment,
    excessive use of force, property damages and causalities in Burqa,
    Majdal Bani Fadel, Urif, Assira al Qibliya, Huwwara, Burin, Qusra,
    Al Lubban Ash Sharqiya, Beit Furik, As Sawiya and Madama (Nablus),

    Qaddum, Jit and Imatin (Qalqiliya), Bardala and Ibziq (Tubas and
    NJV).***

-   ***Most of the incidents were demolitions, live ammunition injuries,
    cutting olive trees, property damages, confiscations, damaged the
    tires of vehicles, writing slogans, intimidations, casualties and
    Displacement due to military training.***

**1.2 PROJECT MEDICALCONTEXT**

-   ***As usual most of the activities in the program were related to
    the emergency MHPSS interventions, including individual
    interventions and group based activities. ***

-   ***Although there wasn't any psycho education session during
    December, the team finalized the final copy of MHPSS Calendar, 2200
    copies were printed and they prepared distribution plan to
    distribute all the quantity before the 10^th^ of January 2019.***

-   ***The team finished the activities in the second step of working
    with PSS teams in 5 directorates in MoEd through implemented monthly
    follow up meetings, accompanied the PSS teams in providing MHPSS
    interventions in 2 schools, finalized the final copy (in the
    printing step) of procedural manual for PSS teams in MoEd which had
    prepared in cooperation with PCC. The team implemented evaluation
    workshop (with representative persons of school counselors,
    supervisors, chairman/ chairwomen of school counselor departments in
    the five directorates) to evaluate the current step, assess their
    needs and plan for the third step in 2019.***

-   ***Volunteer's activity discontinuation workshop had implemented,
    therefore volunteer's activities had been officially closed.***

-   ***The team participated in 16 Days Joint Campaign in Palestine
    (Hear Me Too: Voices against Violence) through implemented
    activities in some of our targeted villages and inside Al Quds Open
    University branches in the four governorates through distributed
    some materials posters, pens and bracelets which contained massages
    to stop GBV in Palestine. People welcomed this initiative and insure
    the need to respect the Palestinian women, Al-Quds Open University
    were more than cooperative with MdM team, the shop owners in the
    villages asked the team to put the posters in their shop's doors.***

-   ***The team continue using the methodology of our interventions and
    its progress described below:***

<!-- -->

-   ***[Strategies for coordination in the responses:]{.underline} MH
    team continue collecting in advance the relevant information to
    organize the interventions through the village council or local
    focal points, and also they are increasing the coordination with
    other organizations especially YMCA to prepare joint interventions,
    avoid duplication and optimize the distribution of our human
    resources.***

-   ***[Organization of the interventions]{.underline}: The recent
    tendency in the increasing of individual interventions and weak
    response of YMCA prevented the team to continue implementing other
    activities such as new PSGs or implement any psycho education
    session; they were more focus to cover all interventions. Also the
    team couldn't build new PSG because of school exams.***

-   ***[Data collection]{.underline}: Internal datasheets for collection
    of data have been reviewed at the end of December. Link to data
    files for the individual and group based activities in the Microsoft
    server:
    <https://mdm1.sharepoint.com/sites/ProgramDataNablus/Documents%20partages/Forms/AllItems.aspx>***

-   ***[MHPSS working group data:]{.underline} The team filled MHPSS
    working group data sheet about MHPSS interventions which had
    implemented by MdM team during the last six months of 2018.***

-   ***[Individual and group supervisions]{.underline}: the internal
    supervision had been stopped because of resignation of MHPM, FieldCo
    and Medco will follow the team through conduct weekly meeting with
    the team to cover gap in the coming period. In the other side the
    external clinical supervisor continue providing individual and group
    supervision sessions for the team.***

+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+

**PROBLEMS FOUND DURING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ACTIVITIES**

-   *Reduction the number of PSGs without open new groups and freezing
    the implementation of psycho education sessions in order to give the
    priority for providing MHPSS interventions as respond for settlers
    and ISF violence incidents which were intensive during December.
    Weak responding from other organizations such as YMCA in providing
    MHPSS interventions which obligated MdM team to cover the majority
    of interventions. Indeed there are other reasons which prevented the
    team to start new PSG or implemented psycho education sessions such
    as participating in GBV campaign, school exams period which
    prevented students and their mothers in participating in any
    activity, some team member attended GBV training and some member
    obligated to took his annual paid leaves before the end of
    December.*

-   *The team continue facing the difficulties of unavailability of
    affected persons while they providing the immediate MHPSS
    interventions and also in the assessment session, which obligated
    them to return back more than one time for the same intervention.*

-   *Postponed the implementation for some PSGs especially in Iraq Burin
    and Qusra many times for several reasons such as security situation,
    the rainy weather and sometimes the team gave priority for another
    activity. *

-   *The team faced challenges because of external supervision
    appointments; the appointments identified by the external supervisor
    in the same week, which affected the team program.*

**3. DATA AND ANALYSIS:**

**3.1 Main Data**

During December, the MH technical team intervened following 27
incidents: 6 ICA incidents, 4 ISF and 17 settler's violence incidents,
compared to 12 incidents from the previous month. This would indicate
the tendency of intensive the settler's violence. It was obvious form
the settlers violence in December that settlers attempted to targeted
different areas in the same time, which indicates that the settlers
violence became more organized, therefore the impact on Palestinians
were strong, some persons who had been visited by MdM team had strong
emotions and felt threatened on their lives when they attacked by
settlers, especially the persons who was attacked while they were moving
between Nablus and Ramallah, also the percentage of the victims who
attended individual PFA sessions was 27% from the whole number of
persons who had visited as support visit in December, while it was 22%
in November, In addition of that the team found the victims welcomed MdM
interventions even it were after more than a week of the incidents, they
expressed the psychological impact during the session and insure their
need for MHPSS intervention. The intensive of settler's violence
incidents increasing the affected number of persons to 170 persons who
achieved the first MHPSS intervention in December, comparing with
November the number was 67 persons.

3.  **Discussion on the data --Analysis/Comments**

-   The average number of incidents had increased more than double
    during December compared to November, there was clear psychological
    impact, people told MdM team that they become more afraid to move
    from area to another especially during the period of settlers
    attacks in WB and during night time and they expecting that the
    settlers violence will be more worse and aggressive in the coming
    months. Indeed the settler violence were more organized during
    December compared with previous settlers attacks, they were divided
    to groups and attacked the villages and cars in the main roads with
    high number of settlers which scared the people and increased the
    emotions of fear, stress, frustration feelings. The total number of
    people affected and attended during the first response to those
    incidents was 170 in December compared to 67 in November.

-   There was decrease on the average number of PSGs; the team couldn't
    open new groups because of school, which helped the team to focus
    more in providing MHPSS intervention.

**4. CONCLUSIONS/ RECOMMENDATIONS **

-   *During December most of PSGs were ended, and there wasn't any
    psycho education session, so the team have to do extra efforts to
    keep the focus in providing MHPSS intervention in addition of taking
    care in building new PSGs and implement psycho education sessions. *

-   *To push the external supervisor to identify the appointments of
    supervision sessions for the first six month of the year.*

-   *To do the annual review for the four team members who Cristiana
    didn't accomplish it with them.*

-   *To start the planning of step three of working with PSS teams in
    MoEd during January. *
